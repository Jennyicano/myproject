**About this project**

This notebook contain my analysis of the famous penguins dataset.

**Use of this project**

This project can be usefull to look at the data related with the Palmer penguins. 

In this data set there are 344 penguins, and the variables that will give us information of those penguins are: type of species (Adelie, Gentoo and Chinstrap), island where they live (Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen), bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass and sex.

After reviewing the data, I found insteresting details about the penguins:
* There are 146 penguins of the species Adelie, 119 of the species Gentoo, and 68 of the species Chinstrap. 
* Of the 344 penguins, 168 are male and 165 are female.
* The species of penguins Gentoo lives only in the island Biscoe. In this island also lives the species Adelie. 
* The island with less population of penguins is Torgersen, with 47 penguins. 

In this project the data can be visualized throught plots, histograms, bar charts and tables.
